# drumMachine

Tried to get familier with React.js , and ofcourse with every new project , you get better with the css part. Learned various things through this project, still need to learn a lot more ;)

drumMachine is a simple beginner level project, which helps you to understand , how React.js works and how it helps us to code the logic in a more easier way also making it more representable at the same time.

Functioning: A simple UI, with few "drumpads" or simply you can say "buttons" , which can be either clicked using mouse or can be triggered using keyboard buttons like Q, W, S, C etc, each pad produces a particular sound upon triggering, thus making it "drum-machine", power button turns the machine on and off, and the BANK selector toggles between the two different sets of sounds assigned to the drumpads.

So, if you can't play the music, you can atleast code it!
